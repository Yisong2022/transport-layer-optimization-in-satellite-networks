1. Introduction

   In recent years, high-bandwidth LEO (Low Earth Orbit) satellite
   networks, such as Starlink and OneWeb, have achieved significant
   development and are gradually becoming an important part of the
   global Internet. However, the LEO satellite networks have unique
   characteristics, which impacts TCP for data transmission.

   o Frequent Handovers and Connection Switching: LEO satellites orbit
      the Earth at high speeds (approximately 7.8 km/s), leading to
      frequent handovers between ground terminals and satellites, as
      well as between satellites themselves (every few to tens of
      minutes). This can cause routing fluctuations, packet loss or
      reordering, and failure of congestion control mechanisms.

   o Signal Quality and Random Packet Loss: Signal quality is affected
      by the distance between satellites and the ground, inter-
      satellite links, Doppler shifts, and weather conditions. These
      factors increase the error rate, leading to random packet loss
      and triggering congestion window reduction, which in turn reduces
      throughput.

   o Solar interference and Packet Loss: Periodic sun interference can
      interrupt signals between satellites, causing packet loss and
      triggering TCP timeout retransmissions. This further leads to
      congestion window reduction and impacts throughput.

   Currently, there are many standardization efforts targeting
   satellite networks, mostly focusing on routing. For example, TVR
   addresses dynamic routing, and TIPTOP focuses on QUIC deployment for
   deep-space satellites. However, there is still a lack of
   standardization work targeting the transport layer for LEO satellite
   networks.

3. Problem Statement

   The unique characteristics of LEO networks-highly dynamic
   topologies, long and variable propagation delays, time-varying
   channel errors pose fundamental challenges to conventional transport
   layer protocols like TCP. These protocols, designed for terrestrial
   networks, fail to adapt to the space environment, leading to
   degraded throughput, increased latency, and unreliable connectivity.

   Study in [2] by Netflix analyzed on-demand video streaming over LEO
   with one million LEO households across 85 countries for over two
   years. Starlink users experience overall perceptual video quality
   similar to non-Starlink networks, they are more likely to experience
   bitrate switches and network rebuffers due to Starlink's network
   conditions. About half of sessions with a bitrate switch experience
   a resolution of less than 1080p. Video rebuffers are significantly
   more likely to occur over Starlink than a Top 10 ISP, and 40% more
   likely to occur relative to any non-Starlink network. It also finds
   that over 95% of Starlink's throughput is lower than alternative
   networks, which is nearly always 50% of what a top 10 ISP offers and
   falls below 20 Mb/s. This eventually leads to bitrate switching and
   rebuffer, which contributes negatively to overall quality of
   experience over Starlink.

   Study in [3] investigated the performance of TCP and UDP in the
   Starlink network. TCP vs. UDP downlink test results consistently
   reveal that UDP outperforms TCP in satellite networks, with the mean

   throughput being 128 Mbps and 29 Mbps, respectively. And the root
   cause is there is a much higher occurrence of packet loss in both
   the uplink and downlink directions in Starlink network. Based on
   this finding, the author verified that TCP parallelism can optimize
   bandwidth utilization by distributing data across multiple
   connections, thereby mitigating the impact of TCP congestion control.

   Study in [4] reveals that the endless and bursty packet losses over
   unstable LEO satellite links impose significant challenges on
   guaranteeing the quality of experience (QoE) of Web applications.
   They found that in the Starlink network environment, both page load
   time and speed index are much higher than those in the wired network.
   Specifically, the 60th/80th/90th percentile page load time in
   Starlink are about 245.0%/202.4%/136.3% higher than those in Optimum.
   Similarly, the 60th/80th/90th percentile speed index in Starlink is
   about 185.3%/241.6%/219.3% higher.

   Various optimizations at the transport protocol level have been
   proposed, such as end-to-end optimizations like SCPS-TP and MP-TCP,
   redundancy coding like FEC, cross-layer optimizations like ECN, and
   congestion control algorithm optimizations like TCP Westwood and TCP
   Eifel, as well as AI-enhanced congestion control. This gives us a
   more indication on what problem we should focused on.

   o Bursty Packet Losses: bursty packet losses are a common
      phenomenon in LEO satellite networks due to various factors such
      as signal blockage from obstacles, rapid movement of satellites,
      and interference from other signals. These bursty losses can
      severely disrupt data transmission, leading to retransmission
      delays and increased latency. Traditional error correction and
      recovery mechanisms may not be effective in handling such bursty
      losses, requiring the development of more robust and adaptive
      techniques.

   o Variable Round Trip Times: the dynamic nature of LEO satellite
      networks results in highly variable Round Trip Times (RTTs). As
      satellites move rapidly across the sky, the distance between the
      sender and receiver changes constantly, causing fluctuations in
      signal propagation delay. Additionally, network congestion and
      routing changes can further exacerbate RTT variations. These
      unpredictable RTTs can lead to inefficient resource utilization
      and performance degradation in transmission protocols that rely
      on accurate timing and synchronization.

   o Large and Variable Delay-Bandwidth Products: the combination of
      high latency and variable bandwidth in LEO satellite networks
      creates large and variable delay-bandwidth products. This makes
      it challenging to maintain efficient data flow and congestion
      control. Transmission protocols need to adapt to these varying
      conditions to optimize throughput and avoid network congestion
      while ensuring fair resource allocation among multiple users and
      applications.

   o High Bit Error Rates: the wireless communication environment of
      LEO satellites is prone to high bit error rates (BER) due to
      factors like signal attenuation, interference, and noise. These
      errors can corrupt data packets, leading to retransmissions and
      reduced overall network efficiency. Effective error detection and
      correction mechanisms are essential to mitigate the impact of
      high BER in LEO satellite transmission protocols.

   o TCP Fairness: there will be competing connections with different
      RTTs. The connections with high RTTs cannot allocate enough
      bandwidth. Traditional TCP protocols may not perform well in such
      environments due to their inherent assumptions about network
      conditions. Developing fair and efficient resource allocation
      mechanisms that consider the unique characteristics of LEO
      satellite networks is necessary to prevent certain users or
      applications from dominating network resources.

   o Security: security is a concern in LEO satellite networks, as
      they are vulnerable to various attacks such as jamming,
      eavesdropping. Transmission protocols must incorporate robust
      security measures to protect data integrity, confidentiality, and
      availability. This includes encryption, authentication, and
      intrusion detection mechanisms tailored to the specific
      challenges of LEO satellite environments.

4. Requirement for transport layer protocol

   Given the unique characteristics of LEO satellite networks, the
   requirements for transport layer protocols should focus on improving
   the following aspects:









Yang                 Expires September 16, 2025               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft  Transport Layer Protocol Req for LEO        March 2025


   o Fast Connection Establishment. In satellite networks, fast
      connection establishment is crucial for improving communication
      efficiency. For short-lived communication needs, such as bursty
      data transmission from mobile users, a slow connection setup
      process can waste significant time. TCP needs to optimize its
      connection establishment process by adopting fast handshake
      algorithms and other techniques to reduce the time required for
      connection setup and enhance the responsiveness of satellite
      networks.

   o High-Bandwidth Support. High-performance transport protocols aim
      to support the rapid transmission of large volumes of data, such
      as high-definition video streaming and big data file transfers.
      When sufficient bandwidth capacity is available in the satellite
      link, the protocol should provide high-bandwidth transmission
      capabilities to meet the demands of these applications.

   o Adaptation to Latency Variations. The latency in satellite
      networks may fluctuate due to factors such as satellite handovers
      and signal interference, causing RTT (Round-Trip Time) jitter.
      Transport protocols need to quickly adapt to this latency jitter
      to avoid performance degradation resulting from congestion window
      changes triggered by the jitter.

   o Error Resistance. Data packet loss in satellite channels can be
      caused by obstructions, atmospheric interference, and spatial
      distance. More efficient packet loss detection and recovery
      mechanisms are needed. For example, redundancy-based encoding
      methods can be introduced, where the sender encodes data with
      redundancy, and the receiver can use this redundant information
      to recover lost packets, reducing the need for retransmissions
      and enhancing the reliability of data transmission.

   o Resilience to Network Interruptions. Short-term interruptions in
      satellite links can easily occur due to sun outages or satellite
      coverage limitations. During such interruptions, the transport
      protocol should reduce the sending rate to minimize unnecessary
      packet transmission. Once the interruption is resolved, the
      protocol should quickly restore the bandwidth to ensure efficient
      data transfer.

   o Reduced Retransmission Rate. Retransmissions increase
      transmission delay and consume bandwidth, which are particularly
      valuable resources in satellite networks. Transport protocols
      need to minimize unnecessary retransmissions through accurate
      packet loss detection and effective error recovery mechanisms,
      thereby optimizing the overall efficiency of data transmission.

   o Improved Out-of-Order Handling. The complex transmission
      environment in satellite networks can cause packets to arrive out
      of order at the receiver due to different routing paths and
      varying transmission delays. Transport protocols must be capable
      of accurately reordering out-of-order packets to ensure the
      correct delivery of data.
