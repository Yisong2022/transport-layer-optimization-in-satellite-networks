Meeting Title: Transport Layer protocol optimization in satellite network
IETF Webex: https://ietf.webex.com/meet/ietfsidemeeting3

Meeting Description: Low-altitude satellite networks frequently switch connections in a short period of time. Since TCP packet loss is very sensitive, it has a great impact on the existing congestion control mechanism of the transport layer. By introducing some common detection mechanisms at the transport layer, we can identify such scenarios and improve transmission quality.
